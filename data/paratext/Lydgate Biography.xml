            <p><emph rend="italic">A brief caveat: this page is by no means meant as a comprehensive
                    biography of Lydgate. It is entirely possible (and others have—see the
                    bibliography at the bottom of this page) to write more than can be comfortably
                    read on a single webpage regarding Lydgate's life and poetic output. Instead,
                    this page serves as a brief orienting overview, intended to give those not
                    well-versed in Lydgate enough of a grounding to understand the transcription and
                    editorial work throughout the site and more importantly to provide readers with
                    an understanding of the major aspects of Lydgate's life as I see them. Since the
                    argument is made throughout the site that all editorial interventions serve as a
                    form of mediation that must be made transparent to the reader, I believe it to
                    be important that readers understand how I as editor perceive the poet. This
                    will serve to help deobfuscate any potential literary black boxes.</emph></p>
            <head type="subhead">Introduction</head>
            <p>Perhaps the most important thing to realize about Lydgate is that despite his
                relative obscurity today he was considered the legitimate successor to Chaucer and
                Gower both during his lifetime and for roughly 150 years following. As his
                near-contemporary Osbern Bokenham commented in his <emph rend="italic">Life of St.
                    Anne</emph></p>
            <p>
                <l>If I hadde cunnyng and eloquens</l>
                <l>My conceytes craftely to dilate,</l>
                <l>Als whilom hadde the fyrsh rethoryens</l>
                <l>Gowere, Chauncere, and now Lytgate (1-4)</l>
            </p>
            <p>As this position in the accepted canon of his time suggests, Lydgate had a
                significant influence over the development of English literature both directly by
                his continuation of the stylistic elements generated or championed by Chaucer and
                indirectly through his sheer output by any numeric measure. He produced, as Derek
                Pearsall notes, "something close to 140,000 lines" of poetry that we can account
                    for.<note place="bottom" anchored="true" n="reference">Pearsall, Derek. <emph
                        rend="italic">John Lydgate (1371-1449) : a bio-bibliography.</emph>
                    Victoria, B.C., Canada: University of Victoria, 1997, 9.</note> Perhaps more
                imporantly, these 140,000 lines have come down to us in over four hundred extant
                witnesses, with significant works such as the <emph rend="italic">Fall of
                    Princes</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Life of Our Lady</emph> existing in
                multiple witnesses. As survival rates of medieval manuscripts, and especially
                English medieval manuscripts with a religious connotation, are low when compared to
                how many were likely produced this speaks to both the prodigiousness of Lydgate's
                output and his popularity as an author.</p>
            <p>Also important for my purposes in developing this site is how much of this poetic
                output has not made its way into our thinking about the poet and his culture. Of the
                476 editions that contain one of the 958 individual witnesses of the 189 items by
                Lydgate in the Digital Index of Middle English Verse (DIMEV):</p>
            <list xml:id="bullet_list">
                <!--<item>43% of the works are unavailable in print or online editions.</item>-->
                <item>67% (645) of the unique witnesses of Lydgate's works are unavailable in print
                    or online editions.</item>
                <item>93% (445) of Lydgate editions were produced over 50 years ago.</item>
                <item>61% (287) of Lydgate editions were produced over 100 years ago.<note
                        place="bottom" anchored="true" n="informational">It should be noted that the
                        major edition of the majority of Lydgate's works, Henry Noble MacCraken's
                            <emph rend="italic">The Minor Poems of John Lydgate</emph> (EETS OS 107
                        and 192) came out in two volumes, the first of which appeared in 1911 and
                        the second in 1934. This puts them on either side of the 100-year line. It
                        should also be noted that the two EETS volumes were reprinted in 1962 and
                        1961, respectively, but since the editor has not changed I do not believe
                        there were any significant changes made.</note></item>
                <item>Only 2% (8) of Lydgate editions were produced since the year 2000.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus, the editions we are using and teaching our students from make assumptions not
                only about the theoretical framework surrounding medieval studies scholarship (after
                all, even if we ignore the theoretical debates of the last twenty years it still has
                to be acknowledged that a hundred or even fifty years ago notions of the middle ages
                that owed more to nineteeth-century racist and nationalist enterprises than an
                understanding of the culture of the period in its own context still held sway), but also about Lydgate
                and the medieval English history writ large. These assumptions often do not hold water on further
                inspection. We won't know, however, because as a culture we have internalized the
                negative opinion of Lydgate promulgated by Joseph Ritson in his <emph rend="italic"
                    >Bibliographica Poetica</emph> and still expressed in conversation, if not in
                print, by most textual scholars working with the English language, including many
                who work in the medieval and early modern periods. Ideally, making more items
                available for scholars to read alongside the editions of the last hundred to hundred
                and fifty years will help us to reassess Lydgate's role in the development of
                late-medieval English culture as well as his role as a poet in the decades following
                his death.<note place="bottom" anchored="true" n="informational">Besides this push
                    to improve the number of witnesses available, treating individual witnesses,
                    complete or partial, as items worthy of study in their own right rather than as
                    adjuncts to a purportedly complete text will help to reforce the ideal of
                    Lydgate as a poet materially connected to his time and culture. Much like today,
                    the fifteenth century has a number of examples of works being adapted, 'remixed'
                    or otherwise altered either through intentional editing or by scribal error. The
                    material aspects of these works, and what those decisions say about the people
                    of the fifteenth century, are obscured through the traditional editorial process
                    even when textual variation is provided by means of footnotes. In essence, each
                    witness is an embodied witness with its own material context, and the site will
                    hopefully help to reinforce that even while remaining aware of its own nature as
                    a virtual adaptation of a material object. </note></p>
            <head type="subhead">Early Life</head>
            <p>John Lydgate, the “monk of Bury,” was born around 1370 in the Suffolk town of
                Lidgate, roughly eight miles from the abbey at Bury St. Edmunds where he would
                spend most of his life. His birthdate can be estimated from two references – line 93
                of the <emph rend="italic">Siege of Thebes</emph>, where he states he is ‘nygh fifty
                yere of age,’ and line 191 of book 8 of the <emph rend="italic">Fall of
                    Princes</emph>, where he talks about his age being ‘mor than thre score yeeris.’
                Since we can date the two poems to roughly around 1420 and 1439, respectively, this
                yields the birth year of 1370.</p>
            <p>Lydgate was taken into the abbey as a boy but by his own account he was not
                particularly religious. He describes himself in the <emph rend="italic"
                    >Testament</emph> as</p>
            <p>
                <l>Voyd of resovn, youe to wilfulnesse</l>
                <l>Froward to vertu, of thryfte take litel hede,</l>
                <l>Loth to lerne, loued no besynesse</l>
                <l>Saue pley or merth, straunge to spelle or rede</l>
                <l>Folowyng alle appetytes longyng to childhede</l>
                <l>Lyghtly turnyng, wylde and selde sad,</l>
                <l>Wepyng for nowȝt, and anone after glad. (614-620)</l>
            </p>
            <p>This could easily be the result of poetic artiface, however. None of the crimes
                Lydgate mentions in the <emph rend="italic">Testament</emph> are particularly
                shocking, and they serve to present the author as a lost lamb in a fairly
                conventional manner. Firmer ground, however, can be found for the moment of
                Lydgate’s conversion, where he claims that, at fifteen, he saw a crucifix in the
                cloister of the abbey with the word “vide” next to it. The change of heart upon
                viewing the crucifix is also a common trope of fifteenth-century confessional
                poetry, but several points of Lydgate’s narrative are not: he mentions that he
                became a novitate at fifteen and took his vows a year later. He attended schooling
                at the monestary while he moved through the minor orders, finally becoming an
                acolyte in 1389. Over the next eight years he would work his way through the ranks,
                becoming a deacon in 1393 and a priest in 1397. </p>
            <p>He attended Gloucester College at Oxford, where he became known to the future Henry
                V: a letter written by the prince sometime between 1406-1408 requests that the abbot
                of Bury allow Lydgate to continue in his studies. It is not known if he completed
                his degree, but this intervention marks the beginning of Lydgate’s personal
                association with the Lancasterian royals. It is one that would continue throughout
                his life.</p>
            <head type="subhead">Court Poet</head>
            <p> From early in his literary career, Lydgate benefited from the patronage of members
                of the Lancastrian court, and it is this aspect of his literary career that receives
                the most attention. As stated above, while a student at Oxford Lydgate apparently
                was to be recalled prematurely from his studies until the future Henry V intervened,
                allowing him to continue. It is unclear if Lydgate finally finished a degree, but
                this relationship with the Lancastrians continued for the rest of his life and much
                of his work was done either at the commission of Lancastrians or in order to support
                the goals of the Lancastrian dynasty. Henry V instigated Lydgate’s work on <emph
                    rend="italic">The Troy Book</emph>, which he was already composing in the months
                prior to Henry's ascension and would finally complete in 1420. He also possibly
                commissioned Lydgate's <emph rend="italic">The Life of Our Lady</emph>. The new
                king's brother Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, commissioned <emph rend="italic">The
                    Fall of Princes</emph>, perhaps Lydgate's most famous work (and certainly the
                most widespread, if the surviving witnesses are any indication!). Finally, Lydgate
                wrote numerous shorter poems to support the rule of the infant Henry VI during his
                long minority, with one of the most significant being "The Lives of Saints Edmund
                and Fremund", a work that was dedicated to Henry VI in order to provide him with an
                example of good rule and presented to him in one of the most elaborate manuscripts
                in existence.</p>
            <p>While on both secular and religious subjects, these poems served as a means to
                promulgate Lancanstrian political policy alongside their moral or entertainment
                value. As stated above, Henry V commissions the <emph rend="italic">Troy
                Book</emph> before he has even taken the throne, with the goal of encouraging the use
                of English over the dialect of French common amongst the nobility of England (think
                Chaucer's mention of the French of "Stratford atte Bowe" in his description of the
                Prioress in his General Prologue). That use of English, in turn, would solidify an
                English national identity and, perhaps as importantly, the Lancanstrian central
                position in that identity. The composition of the <emph rend="italic">Life of Our
                    Lady</emph> may also have been encouraged by Henry as part of this program of
                elevating the position of English, as well as to undermine the position of the
                Lollards as the champions of religious verse in the vernacular. He is also reported
                to have written the "Benedic anima mea domino" for the chapel at Windsor and the
                "Eight Verses of St. Bernard" for the newly-ascended Henry’s own use at Mass.</p>

            <head type="subhead">Civic Poet</head>
            <p>Among the aforementioned shorter poems written in support of Henry VI are a number of
                performance pieces that would have involved the wider citizenry of fifteenth-century
                London. Thus, Lydgate also worked as a civic poet. His involvement with the larger
                public provided incidental poems on life in the community and pieces commissioned by
                such guilds as the goldsmiths, mercers, and armorers, often framed as performance
                pieces. While many of these pieces come to us through texts in manuscript, it is
                known that a number of them, including "Bycorne and Chychevache" and the "Legend of
                St. George" for the Armorers of London, were originally produced for extra-codical
                purposes. Likewise, as I have written about elsewhere the "Testament" was rendered
                in an extracodical context at Holy Trinity, Long Melford in a version that is
                markedly different in the choice of verses displayed than any of the versions in the
                codex, and intended for a lay piety that has as much to do with community cohesion
                as with religious edification.</p>
            <head type="subhead">Dramatist</head>
            <p>Although a writer of both dramatic and poetic works, Lydgate is often most remembered
                for the latter. As Claire Sponsler has pointed out, this is an artifact of the
                association between the poetic form and “literature,” which has significant impacts
                on our understanding of English culture in the middle ages. <note place="bottom"
                    anchored="true" n="reference">Sponsler, Claire. <emph rend="italic">The Queen’s
                        Dumbshows: John Lydgate and the Making of Early Theater</emph> (U of
                    Pennsylvania P, 2014), 1-12.</note> It has also worked to the detriment of our
                understanding of medieval drama in general and Lydgate’s works in particular,
                especially because the frame of Lydgate as "poet," full stop, has shaped what works
                of his are anthologized and the development of what is considered to be his
                canonical works.</p>
            <p>Lydgate's dramatic works are primarily in two witnesses, British Library Addit. 29729
                and Cambridge Trinity R.3.20, with a single outlier in Bodleian Ashmole 59. In those
                manuscripts they are primarily called "mummings" or "disguisings," but there are
                several items that have dramatic elements that are performative, but may not be
                "drama" as we think of it today. These include "Henry VI's Triumphal Entry into
                London," "A Pageant of Knowledge,"<note/> and "A Procession of Corpus Christi,"
                which have similarities in structure to several established dramatic works such as
                the York and Chester cycle plays and the Digby <emph rend="italic">Mary
                    Magdalene</emph>. For this reason, it is likely worthwhile to reconsider all of
                Lydgate's poetic output as potential performance pieces beyond basic recitation,
                and—as Sponsler suggests—give more consideration to Lydgate as dramatist than is
                currently considered.</p>
            <head type="subhead">Connections to Chaucer</head>
            <p>Lydgate’s connections to Chaucer have been long and well established. Lydgate pays
                explicit homage to Chaucer in such works as <emph rend="italic">The Life of Our
                    Lady</emph> and <emph rend="italic">The Siege of Thebes</emph>. The latter of
                these works he presents as a continuation of <emph rend="italic">The Canterbury
                    Tales</emph>, complete with a frame in which Lydgate sets himself up as a
                pilgrim narrator in the vein of Chaucer’s own pilgrim persona. Chaucer’s influence
                on Lydgate is so thorough that Lydgate incorporates lines and phrases from Chaucer
                into his own verse and even solidifies the place of words coined by Chaucer into
                English by using them again and again. As seen by Bokenham's reference above,
                Lydgate holds the same position for the generation that follows him.</p>
            <head type="subhead">The "Monk of Bury"</head>
            <p>A final sphere in which Lydgate wrote was the religious. The village of his birth was
                in the radius of influence for the powerful Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and it was this
                monastic house that provided him with his basic education as a child and in which he
                eventually became a brother. In addition to such lengthy examples as <emph
                    rend="italic">The Life of Our Lady</emph> and "The Lives of Saints Edmund and
                Fremund," Lydgate’s corpus includes many shorter devotional poems and saint’s lives.
                A number of these poems even make reference to Bury and to Lydgate’s abbot,
                indicating the clear importance of his brethren to his work and daily life.</p>
