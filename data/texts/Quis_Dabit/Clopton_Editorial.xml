            <p>These notes are loosely based on the system described by Michelle P. Brown in her
                <emph rend="italic">Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600</emph> (Toronto,
                1993), but modified for the purposes of presentation of a painted inscription on the web. This is especially
                evident in the case of damage. Since the text
                is paint on wooden panels, rather than ink on a parchment or paper support, it makes
                it more likely that parts of letters can be lost through flaking, but the letter
                itself is still legible. Indicating damage is this way differs from the standard
                practice in Brown. For this reason, the editor has provided the following guide to
                his practice:</p>
            <div xml:id="EditNotes">
                <list type="bulleted">
                    <item>Expanded abbreviations in the text are indicated thusly:
                        ex<ex>am</ex>ple.</item>
                    <item>Damaged material is indicated thusly: <damage>example</damage>.</item>
                    <!--<item>Supplied material is indicated via the use of brackets surrounding the
                        supplied item. Where there are multiple types of supplied material, the
                        following is used: <list type="bulleted">
                        <item>Material where the text is damaged, but visible enough that the text
                            can be understood with the aid of other witnesses: <supplied
                            reason="illegible">example</supplied>.</item>
                        <item>Material where the text is completely missing and must be supplied
                            entirely from other witnesses: <supplied reason="damage"

                        </list> In both cases, the source of the supplied material is given in the
                        attributes of the underlying TEI-encoding for the text. It should be
                        understood that where the item can be understood via the aid of other
                        witnesses, but the text appears to differ in form from those other versions
                        the provided transcription will be modified accordingly.</item>-->

                    <item>Specific issues regarding the text will be indicated via a
                        footnote either immediately after the item referenced or at the end of the line. They have been color-coded to indicate the type of note they are: <list type="bulleted">
