                    <history>
                        <p>From the period between 1464 and 1494 the Church of the Holy Trinity in
                            the Parish of Long Melford, Suffolk underwent an extensive remodeling
                            and expansion, largely under the auspices of a successful wool merchant,
                            John Clopton. While he provided funds for, or was the executor of
                            bequests to, a number of parish chruches in his area, Long Melford was
                            Clopton’s own parish church, and as part of the remodeling process he
                            endowed a permanent chantry north of the high altar intended to serve as
                            means for the salvation of his soul, the souls of his family, and the
                            souls of those he was legally and morally obligated to pray for. As part

                            must be intended there. Likewise, the suspension mark at the end of the
                            line, which moves too far to the left to be the descender of the “y” in
                            the line above, indicates an abbreviation in the terminal word. The
                            remainder is determined from the manuscript witnesses.</note>

                            by the remnants on the panel, but the particular form of the word
                            “altar” cannot be determined as the fourth word is too damaged and the
