                            the Parish of Long Melford, Suffolk underwent an extensive remodeling
                            and expansion, largely under the auspices of a successful wool merchant,
                            John Clopton. While he provided funds for, or was the executor of
                            bequests to, a number of parish chruches in his area, Long Melford was
                            Clopton’s own parish church, and as part of the remodeling process he
                            endowed a permanent chantry north of the high altar intended to serve as
                            means for the salvation of his soul, the souls of his family, and the
                            souls of those he was legally and morally obligated to pray for. As part
                            of the process of building the chantry a number of verses from religious
                            works in both Latin and English were included. Thus, the chapel itself
                            served as a type of <i>compilatio</i> centered on
                            the ideas of penance and salvation.</p></div><div id="physical_description"><!--this whole section needs to be better written.  The sections will be used to make up the appropriate bits of html --><div class="description_category" id="physical_structure"><h3>Physical Structure</h3><div class="description_subcategory" id="support"><h4>Support</h4><p>The text of the <i>Quis Dabit Meo Capiti
                                            Fontem Lacrimarum</i> is composed on badly damaged
                                        painted panels intended to appear like scrollwork wrapped
                                        around a typical vinework motif.</p></div><div class="description_subcategory" id="layout"><h4>Layout</h4><p>In keeping with the majority of the source
                                        material, the poem is laid out in eight line ballade
                                        stanzas, with line fillers where the text is too short for
                                        the provided space. As the intention of the panels on which
                                        the lines were painted is to give the appearance of a single
                                        continous scroll, the left and right sides of these panels
                                        are at an angle to the orientation of the lines, but the
                                        lines themselves are presented with parallel to the ground
                                        for ease of reading</p></div></div><div class="description_category" id="hands"><h3>Scribal Hand</h3><p>Like the other objects in the chapel, the text of
                                    the <span class="ex">Quis Dabit</span> is written by what appears to be a
                                    single painter/scribe in Textura Quadrata. There is some
                                    Anglicana influence, however; it is most notable in the use of
                                    Anglicana “w” but also can be seen in the similarities between
                                    “f” and the tall “s” and the form of “r” in the “or”
                                    ligature.</p><div class="description_subcategory" id="otiose"><h4>Ascenders, descenders, and otiose marks</h4><p>The scribe consistently splits ascenders and
                                    descenders when they are either the full height of the line (as
                                    in “b,” “h,” and “l”) or at the midpoint between full height and
                                    that of regular letters (as with “t,” “p,” and “q”).
                                    Additionally, otiose marks appear to the left or right of “f”
                                    and “t” when they are the initial or last letter in a word, at
                                    the end of “e” when it completes a word, and at the end of
                                    suspension marks.</p></div><!-- add attribute to schema --><div class="description_subcategory" id="capitals"><h4>Capitals and illumination</h4><p>Capitals are depicted in red and written in
                                    Insular rather than the Textura of the main body of the text.
                                    This is consistent with the scribal practice and heirarchy of
                                    scripts seen in many of the manuscript witnesses and underscores
                                    the connection between them despite the majority of the text
                                    being rendered in Textura and not Anglicana.</p></div></div></div><div class="description_category" id="manuscript_contents"><h3>Manuscript Contents</h3><ul><li>Center Beam<ul><li>Sections of the invocation to Christ from the Sarum litany between
