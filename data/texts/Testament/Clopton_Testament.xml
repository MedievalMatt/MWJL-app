                                        themselves are presented with parallel to the ground for

                    <history>
                        <p>From the period between 1464 and 1494 the Church of the Holy Trinity in
                            the Parish of Long Melford, Suffolk underwent an extensive remodeling
                            and expansion, largely under the auspices of a successful wool merchant,
                            John Clopton. While he provided funds for, or was the executor of
                            bequests to, a number of parish chruches in his area, Long Melford was
                            Clopton’s own parish church, and as part of the remodeling process he
                            endowed a permanent chantry north of the high altar intended to serve as
                            means for the salvation of his soul, the souls of his family, and the
                            souls of those he was legally and morally obligated to pray for. As part
                            of the process of building the chantry a number of verses from religious
                            works in both Latin and English were included. Thus, the chapel itself
                            served as a type of <emph rend="italic">compilatio</emph> centered on
                            the ideas of penance and salvation.</p>

                                “our<ex>e</ex>” is a linguistic outlier for the area based on the

                            “u” of “our” are clear in the fourth word on the line. Likewise, the
                            number of minims and the lack of an otiose mark for the final letter
                            make it clear it is “laste” rather than “last,” and the otiose marks
                            beginning and ending the word and the number of minims make it clear it
                            is “testament.” The bottom as well as the top of the words at the
                            beginning of the line is sometimes missing, making any judgments
                            regarding spelling more speculative there. The abbreviation for the
                            final “e” in “oure” is based on how the word is formed elsewhere on the

                            “seruants,” the lack of a any indication of a suspension mark, and the
                            lack of the finishing stroke on the leftmost minim on the remnant of the
                            fourth letter indicates that this is the intended spelling. Likewise,
                            the rightmost minim of the third letter of the second word indicates
                            that this should be “saue” rather than “save,” which is consistent with
                            scribe’s decisions between the two in the rest of the chapel.
                            Additionally, slight remnants of the terminal “d” and the unique
                            descender of the “r” in the “or” ligature in the word “lord” can be
                            seen, making it likely “olord” rather than the two words separately. See
                            “hosell” at the bottom of the panel for an example of how the scribe
                            connects “o” to letters with tall ascenders.</note>

                            “a.” The fourth word can be determined by the tittle above the break.
                            The fifth can be determined by the otiose mark for initial “t,” and the
                            “o” following can be determined from context. The “me” at the end of the

                            mark the scribe places at the end of e. The second letter of the word
                            can also be determined to be e, and the remains around it makes the
                            letters on either side likely to be “r” and “f” based on the manuscript
                            witnesses. The seventh cannot be determined definitively by the evidence
                            as the remnants fit neither “you” nor “the” sufficently, but the eighth
                            can based on the last four letters of the word, the initial letter “g”

                            are determined based on the remains of the minims and the general
                            practice of the scribe in only using “v” as the initial letter of

                            the minims of the fifth word remains. The sixth can be determined from
                            the minims of the initial “o” and the otiose mark that terminates both
                            “f” and “t.” The seventh word can be determined by remnants of the

                            witnesses, which indicate that the remainder of the word is two “l’s”
                            rather than two minims of a single letter. The remnants of the bow for
